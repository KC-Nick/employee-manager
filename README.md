# Employee Manager

## Description

This app allows for the user to start up a database to track their business by department, role, and employee. Currently, one can add new departments/roles/employees, update employee roles, delete anything entered, and view by department/employee with their title/roles with their department. Simply answer the questions provided by inquirer, and the results will be entered into the database and shown in the console.

  ## Installation

  If you would like to install this code use `git clone` to clone the repository, `git status` to check if your version is up to date, or `git pull` to update any cloned code with current pushes. To start up the app, first use `mysql -u root -p ` to sign into mysql, source the schema.sql file to build the database and tables (copy path to file if it won't allow `source schema.sql`), if you would like some automatic entries use the `seeds.sql` to fill in the tables.

  ## Future Plans

  I would like to add more features to this project, such as the features to select employees by department or manager, updating managers, and viewing the combined budget of employee pay by department.
